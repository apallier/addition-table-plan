Calculation tables
==================

This project contains layouts to make tables to teach children the calculation. 

Addition Table
--------------
It is a copy of the [Montessori Addition table](http://www.montessorialbum.com/montessori/index.php?title=Addition_With_Strip_Board).

I made 2 types of layouts : 
- 3D Printing layout (skp and stl) 
- Laser Cutting layout (svg)

With theses files, you can make the pieces which get with the board.
Then layout of the board is coming soon.
